✅ **Project description**  

* Check the [project information](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p3_collab-compet) (multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL))   

* Check the [course notes](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s139/sh/3207cf3f-bcca-a008-c221-45bbd101af72/qBMCR47uxmw1ied7hOLgWCxDfJFWUgoKErH3sbCLoIOTVUIw0x_YVyPiBw)    

  In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

  The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

  The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

  - After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
  - This yields a single **score** for each episode.

  The environment is considered solved, when **the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5**.
 


✅ **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) solution**  

* [**MADDPG**, or **Multi-agent DDPG**](https://paperswithcode.com/method/maddpg), extends DDPG into a multi-agent policy gradient algorithm where decentralized agents learn a centralized critic based on the observations and actions of all agents. It leads to learned policies that only use local information (i.e. their own observations) at execution time, does not assume a differentiable model of the environment dynamics or any particular structure on the communication method between agents, and is applicable not only to cooperative interaction but to competitive or mixed interaction involving both physical and communicative behavior. The critic is augmented with extra information about the policies of other agents, while the actor only has access to local information. After training is completed, only the local actors are used at execution phase, acting in a decentralized manner.  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nov05/pictures/refs/heads/master/Udacity/20231221_reinforcement%20learning/Screen_Shot_2020-06-04_at_10.11.20_PM.png" width=300>     

* DDPG relies on a single Q-network to estimate action values, which can lead to overestimation and make it harder to converge, especially in multi-agent environments. In contrast, [**TD3, or Twin Delayed DDPG**](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/td3.html) uses two Q-networks (typically taking the smaller Q-value) to minimize overestimation. It also adds clipped noise to the target actor’s outputs when calculating target Q-values, which helps smooth out the critic’s losses, thereby improving the overall stability during training. For each agent, **6 networks** (1 local actor, 2 local critics, 1 target actor, and 2 target critics) and **1 replay buffer** will be created. During training, an agent can access the observations and actions of other agents. During execution, however, each agent relies on its own observations and receives actions from its own local actor.  

* **Prioritized replay buffers** are used to improve the speed of convergence, since the rewards are very sparse.

* Multi-environments, implemented using the `multiprocessing` library (check the file [`..\python\baselines\baselines\common\vec_env\subproc_vec_env.py`](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/baselines/baselines/common/vec_env/subproc_vec_env.py)), can be used for parallel training here, which can add diversity to the experiences. Additionally, asynchronous stepping may help speed up the training and evalation processes.

✅ **Implementation**    

* Reuse the `DDPG` framework from P2-Unity Reacher (multi-envs, many resuable functions and components, etc.)
  - All the code is integrated with [ShangtongZhang's deeprl framework](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL/tree/master/deep_rl) which uses some OpenAI Baselines functionalities.
  - One task can step multiple envs, either with a single process, or with multiple processes. multiple tasks can be stepped synchronously.  

* Instantiate [the `DeterministicActorCriticNet` class](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/network/network_heads.py) to create 4-6 Networks (2 objects) per agent:   
    actor-critic(s), target actor-critic(s)  

* Soft updates for target networks, AdamW optimizer on actor-critic(s) networks  

* A central [Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) buffer](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/component/replay.py):  
  - Storing new memories, priority sampling, updating priorities using critic Q-values  

* [The `MADDPGAgent` class](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/agent/MADDPG_agent.py) to choose actions, do soft updates, save models  

* [The `Task` class](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/component/envs.py) to handle list of agents and train/eval functions  

* Utility functions to reshape the observations and actions, etc.

* Human readable logs and tensorboard logs  
  - Train and eval tasks create both readable and tensorboard logs  
  - [The plot functionality](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/experiments/deeprl_maddpg_plot.py) uses tensorboard log data 

* [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) 
  - training logs and sweeping  



✅ **Coding**

* An env has 2 agents playing with each other. Refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p3_collab-compet/Tennis.ipynb).  
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nov05/pictures/refs/heads/master/Udacity/20231221_reinforcement%20learning/2024-10-30%2017_28_41-udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning_p3_collab-compet_Tennis.ipynb%20at%20master%20%C2%B7%20No.jpg" width=600>

* Create `class MADDPGAgent(BaseAgent)` in the file [`..\python\deeprl\agent\MADDPG_agent.py`](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/agent/MADDPG_agent.py).

* Create train and eval functions in the file [`..\python\experiments\deeprl_maddpg_continuous.py`](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/experiments/deeprl_maddpg_continuous.py).  

* Add the brain name **'TennisBrain'** and the episodic return logic in the function `get_return_from_brain_info()` in the file [`..\python\deeprl\component\envs.py`'](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/component/envs.py).   

  In the `get_env_fn()` function, for `Gym` games, the environment class is wrapped using `OriginalReturnWrapper()`. Inside the wrapper class's `step()` and `reset()` method, `info['episodic_return'] = self.total_rewards` is defined. However, for `Unity` games, the environment is already instantiated at the same location, so it can't be wrapped with an wrapper class. Instead, we define `info['episodic_return']` within classes `UnityVecEnv` and `UnitySubprocVecEnv`, which call the `get_return_from_brain_info()` function where `info` is actually populated.  

  For the Tennis game, we sum the rewards each agent receives (without discounting) to get individual scores for both agents, resulting in two potentially different scores. We then take the higher score as the episodic return. However, since the two agents are always competing, one score eventually becomes consistently higher by about 0.11. To simplify, we can use the average of the scores as the episodic return without changing any related code. This means if the target score is 0.5, an average score above 0.445 would indicate the environment is solved.

* The class `PrioritizedReplay` implementation is in the file [`..\deeprl\component\replay.py`](https://github.com/Nov05/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/python/deeprl/component/replay.py)  

* Local and target actor-critic netowrks architecture (It can be found in each human readable log file.)

✅ **Training**  

* **DDPG + uniform replay**    

  * Some of the hyperparameters   
    ```Python  
    config.min_memory_size = int(1e6)
    config.mini_batch_size = 256
    config.replay_fn = lambda: PrioritizedReplay(memory_size=config.min_memory_size, 
                                                 batch_size=config.mini_batch_size)
    config.discount = 0.99  ## λ lambda, Q-value discount rate
    config.random_process_fn = lambda: GaussianProcess(
        size=(config.action_dim,), std=LinearSchedule(0.3))  ## noise to add
    config.noise_decay_rate = 0.3  ## config.random_process.sample() * (1/(self.total_episodes+1)**config.noise_decay_rate)
    ## before it is warmed up, use random actions, do not sample from buffer or update neural networks
    config.warm_up = int(1e4) ## can't be 0 steps, or it will create a deadloop in buffer
    config.replay_interval = 1  ## replay-policy update every n steps
    config.actor_update_freq = 2  ## update the actor once for every n updates to the critic
    config.target_network_mix = int(5e-3)  ## τ: soft update rate = 0.5%, trg = trg*(1-τ) + src*τ
    ```

  * With this setting, the model successfully solved the environment, achieving an average score **above 0.5** after **60,000 training steps** (around 1,200 episodes). The progress slowed afterward (slower to reach higher scores), likely due to excessive noise and an insufficient decay rate. However if add too little noise at the start, the model easily gets stuck and hard to move on, if add too much moise latter, the training score climbs slowly.     
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nov05/pictures/refs/heads/master/Udacity/20231221_reinforcement%20learning/20241101_imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-uty9fO98pZoX.jpg" width=600>  

* **TD3 + prioritized replay**  

  * Some of the hyperparameters  
    ```Python
    config.min_memory_size = int(1e5)
    torch.optim.AdamW(params, lr=1e-4) for all the networks
    config.random_process_fn = lambda: GaussianProcess(
        size=(config.action_dim,), std=LinearSchedule(1))
    config.action_noise_factor = 0.1
    config.policy_noise_factor = 0.2
    config.noise_clip = (-0.5, 0.5)
    ```

  * With this setup, the model achieved **an average score of 0.50** between episodes 4336 and 4435 (step 157,506), and **peaked at 2.6** around step 200,000.   
  Check [the training logs on W&B](https://wandb.ai/nov05/udacity-drlnd-matd3-unity-tennis/runs/ehq0fw4a).  
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nov05/pictures/refs/heads/master/Udacity/20231221_reinforcement%20learning/2024-11-17%2003_32_18-Streamlabs%20Desktop.jpg" width=800>  

  * One of the main challenges in this environment is the sparse reward structure, which can easily cause training to stall, particularly during the early stages. For example, [check some of the training metrics in the early stages.](https://wandb.ai/nov05/udacity-drlnd-matd3-unity-tennis/runs/d6vd5lbz?nw=nwusernov05) The training score might level off around 0.06 for approximately 400,000 steps before it begins to improve. Additionally, the training process is highly sensitive to hyperparameter settings, making it difficult to find a configuration that leads to convergence. I've come across research areas like 'sparse rewards' and 'reward reshaping,' which could potentially help improve performance.  

  * If one or both of the actor losses didn’t decrease (oscillating or even increasing) during the early stages of training, it means the model wasn’t learning and would typically end up with a score close to 0.

## **👉 Unity ML-Agents `Banana Collectors` (Project Submission)**

1. For this toy game, two `Deep Q-network` methods are tried out. Since the observations (states) are simple (not in pixels), convolutional layers are not in use. And the evaluation results confirm that linear layers are sufficient for solving the problem.   
	* **Double DQN**, with 3 linear layers (hidden dims: 256\*64, later tried with 64\*64)  
	* **Dueling DQN**, with 2 linear layers + 2 split linear layers (hidden dims: 64\*64)  

▪️ The Dueling DQN architecture is displayed as below. 

<table>
<tr>
<th> Dueling Architecture </th>
<th> The green module </th>

</td>
</tr>
</table>  

▪️ Since both the advantage and the value stream propagate gradients to the last convolutional layer in the backward pass, we rescale the combined gradient entering the last convolutional layer by 1/√2. This simple heuristic mildly increases stability.

```Python
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 64)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.layer3_adv = nn.Linear(in_features=64, out_features=action_size) ## advantage
        self.layer3_val = nn.Linear(in_features=64, out_features=1) ## state value

    def forward(self, state):
        x = F.relu(self.layer1(state))
        x = F.relu(self.layer2(x))
        adv, val = self.layer3_adv(x), self.layer3_val(x)
        return (val + adv - adv.mean(1).unsqueeze(1).expand(x.size(0), action_size)) / (2**0.5)
```  

▪️ In addition, we clip the gradients to have their norm less than or equal to 10. This clipping is not standard practice in deep RL, but common in recurrent network training (Bengio et al., 2013).

```Python 
        ## clip the gradients
        nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.qnetwork_local.parameters(), 10.)
        nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.qnetwork_target.parameters(), 10.) 
```

2. The following picture shows the train and eval scores (rewards) for both architectures. Since it is a toy project, trained models are not formally evaluated. We can roughly see that Dueling DQN slightly performs better with **an average score of 17** vs. Double DQN 13 in 10 episodes.
